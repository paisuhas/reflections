Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A. When I initialize a repository, git creates the metadata files needed to keep track of my repository. I need to do it to enable git to keep track of my changes to the repository.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A. Staging area is different from the working area in that the staging area only contains files that are to be a part of the next commit. Having a staging area helps us avoid having to commit all changes made to the repository at once. The commits can be made in a sequence of logical changes.

Q. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A. Use git diff --staged to verify that the output you see is the logical change you wish to commit.

Q. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
A. Branches are helpful when we want to try out an experiment on the codebase but do not want to commit it to the main code. So we use branches to create a copy of the code and try out our experiments in the branch. Branches can also be used when a single project has two different end goals. We can build up the fundamental code on the master branch and then branch to create 2 different offshoots.
